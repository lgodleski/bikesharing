<br> The majority of subscribers, both men and women, used a Citibike on Thursday whereas customers (male, female, and gender unknown) typically checked out more bikes on Saturdays and Sundays. 

## Summary
From this analysis we can see that the majority of NYC Citibike users are annual subscribers, male, and typically checkout bikes for about 5 minutes on Thursday evenings between 5 and 6pm. Female users follow similar trends they just make up less of the total user base. For future analysis, I would suggest looking at the age ranges of users and how that impacts trip duration. 
<br>
![](Resources/user_age.png)
<br>We can see that a disproportionately large group of Citibike users were born in 1969.
<br>
<br>
![](Resources/trip_duration_by_age.png)
<br>These users that were born in 1969 also have the longest trip duration records, ranging from about 7 - 20 minutes.
